      <p>Our planet, our home. Where every person you've known and ever will know, will live out there lives. A small speck within the vastness of our Universe.</p>
      <img alt="black hole">
      <p>One of if not the most mysterious object in the Universe. We know how they form and what would most likely happen if you went in one, but there's still so much to learn about these.</p>
      <img alt="galaxy">
      <p>This is where we live, but this only one of millions, if not more that we know of. Who knows what lies within all those other galaxies.</p>

      <p>Another very mysterious object that I will research more about and then write about here. </p>
